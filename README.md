# mrflow
*A package for expedited Mendelian Randomization analysis of population data.*

## Future Implementation
[ ] A standard MR data prep workflow, including one-shot execution of:
	[ ] Interconversion between gene symbols, synonyms, ENSGs, Entrez, etc
	[ ] SNP retrieval from database
	[ ] Automatic pruning for LD--perhaps worth exploring writing own LD algo since it won't require any sort of web interfacing
	[ ] Conduct Two-Sample MR w/ summary statistic SNPs
